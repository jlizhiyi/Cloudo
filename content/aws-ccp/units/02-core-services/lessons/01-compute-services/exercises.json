    "options": [
      "You pay for servers even when they are idle",

      "You only pay for the compute time consumed by code execution",
      "Scaling must be managed manually"

    "correct": 2,

      "Serverless functions (e.g. Lambda)",

    "options": [
      "They are slower to start than Virtual Machines",
