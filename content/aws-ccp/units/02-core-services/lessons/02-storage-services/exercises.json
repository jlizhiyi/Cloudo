    "options": [
      "Object Storage",
      "Block Storage",
      "Archive Storage",
      "File Storage"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Block storage acts like a physical hard drive. It is required for databases and boot volumes because it supports frequent read/write operations with low latency."

    "question": "Why is Object Storage NOT suitable for running a fast, transactional database?",
    "options": [
      "It is too expensive",
      "It does not support encryption",
      "It treats data as whole objects; you cannot edit a single block of a file",
      "It has limited capacity"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Object storage is 'Write Once, Read Many'. To edit a file, you must re-upload the entire object. Databases need Block storage to edit tiny pieces of data instantly."
