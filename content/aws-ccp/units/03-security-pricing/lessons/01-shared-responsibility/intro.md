# The Shared Responsibility Model

Security is a partnership. If you don't do your part, the application is not secure.

### The Provider: Security OF the Cloud
They protect the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the Cloud. This includes:
*   **Physical Security:** Guards, locks, fences, power, and cooling.
*   **Hardware:** Servers, storage devices, and networking equipment.
*   **Software:** The virtualization layer and host operating systems.

### The Customer: Security IN the Cloud
You are responsible for everything you put **into** the cloud.
*   **Data:** Encryption (at rest and in transit).
*   **Configuration:** Firewall rules, open ports, and permissions.
*   **Identity:** Creating users, assigning roles, and enforcing MFA.
*   **OS Patches:** If you run a Virtual Machine, YOU must update Windows/Linux.

**Rule of Thumb:** If you can edit the setting in the console, you are likely responsible for it.
