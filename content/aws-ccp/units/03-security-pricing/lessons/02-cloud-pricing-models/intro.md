# Cloud Pricing Models

Optimizing cost is a pillar of good cloud architecture.

### 1. On-Demand
Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second.
*   **No commitment.**
*   **Use case:** Short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads. Testing a new app.

### 2. Reserved Instances (or Savings Plans)
Commit to a specific amount of usage for **1 or 3 years**.
*   **Discount:** Up to 72% off On-Demand.
*   **Use case:** Steady-state usage (e.g., a database that runs 24/7).

### 3. Spot Instances
Bid on unused cloud capacity.
*   **Discount:** Up to 90% off.
*   **Risk:** The provider can terminate your instance with a 2-minute warning if they need the capacity back.
*   **Use case:** Batch processing, data analysis, or anything that can "fail safely."

### 4. Free Tier
Most providers offer a free tier (usually for 12 months) so you can learn the platform without paying.
