# Cloud Deployment Models

There are several ways to deploy cloud resources, each suited to different needs and constraints.

### 1. Public Cloud
Your applications run entirely on a cloud provider's infrastructure (like AWS, Azure, or GCP).
*   **Key Trait:** You share the underlying hardware with other customers (multi-tenancy), but your data is isolated.
*   **Best For:** Startups, web applications, and companies wanting to avoid hardware management.

### 2. Private Cloud
Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization. It can be on-premises or hosted by a third party.
*   **Key Trait:** Single-tenant environment.
*   **Best For:** Highly regulated industries (banking, government) that require strict data isolation or control.

### 3. Hybrid Cloud
Connects your on-premises infrastructure (or private cloud) with public cloud services.
*   **Key Trait:** Data and apps move between private and public environments.
*   **Best For:** Enterprises with legacy systems that can't move to the cloud yet ("Cloud Bursting" is a common use case).

### 4. Multi-Cloud
Using services from multiple cloud providers (e.g., using AWS for compute and Google Cloud for BigData).
*   **Key Trait:** Prevents vendor lock-in.
*   **Best For:** Flexibility and redundancy across providers.
