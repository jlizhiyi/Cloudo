    "options": [
      "CapEx is pay-as-you-go; OpEx is paying upfront",
      "CapEx requires guessing capacity; OpEx allows scaling on demand",
      "CapEx is for software; OpEx is for hardware",
      "There is no difference in the cloud"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "CapEx (Capital Expense) involves large upfront investments in physical infrastructure where you must guess capacity. Cloud computing operates on Variable Expense (OpEx), allowing you to pay only for what you consume."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In the public cloud, you give up physical control of the data center (locks, guards, fencing) to the provider in exchange for not having to manage it."
