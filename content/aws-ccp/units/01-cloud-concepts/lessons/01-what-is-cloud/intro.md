# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of IT resources over the internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services—such as computing power, storage, and databases—on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider.

Think of it like electricity: you don't own a power plant, you just plug in and pay for what you use. Cloud computing works the same way for IT resources.

### Key Benefits

1. **Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense:** Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources.
2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale:** Because of aggregate usage from hundreds of thousands of customers, providers can achieve lower pay-as-you-go prices than you can get on your own.
3. **Stop guessing capacity:** You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.
4. **Increase speed and agility:** New IT resources are just a click away, which means you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.
5. **Go global in minutes:** Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks.

**NOTE:** No cloud provider guarantees **100% uptime**. Even the best services target 99.99% availability (often called "four nines"), which still allows for potential minutes of downtime per year.
